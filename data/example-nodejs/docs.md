Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

***

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js that helps developers install, share, and manage dependencies. It hosts over a million packages in the npm registry, making it the largest software registry in the world.

***

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, enabling better tooling, error catching at compile-time, and improved code maintainability. It compiles to plain JavaScript and runs anywhere JavaScript runs.

***

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's the most popular Node.js framework for building RESTful APIs and web servers.

***

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, it uses a component-based architecture and virtual DOM for efficient rendering and state management.

***

Magellan is a TypeScript library that simplifies remote service execution and API development between frontend and backend. It automatically generates code for both sides, provides transparent transport layers, and enables frontend services to consume Node.js modules with effortless configuration and error handling.

***

Vite is a modern build tool that provides fast development server startup and hot module replacement for JavaScript projects. It leverages native ES modules and esbuild for lightning-fast builds, making it an excellent alternative to traditional bundlers like Webpack.

***

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications that processes and bundles assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images. It creates a dependency graph and generates optimized bundles for deployment.

***

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook that works well with React applications. It provides features like snapshot testing, mocking, and code coverage reporting out of the box.

***

ESLint is a static analysis tool for identifying and fixing problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It helps maintain code quality and consistency across teams by enforcing coding standards and catching potential errors.

***

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports many languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS. It automatically formats code according to consistent style rules, eliminating debates about code formatting.

***

Nodemon is a utility that monitors changes in Node.js applications and automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected. It's essential for development workflows to avoid manual server restarts.
