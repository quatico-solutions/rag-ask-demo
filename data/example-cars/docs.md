Electric drivetrains use electric motors powered by onboard batteries. They deliver instant torque, zero tailpipe emissions, and are central to modern electric vehicles from mass-market to performance segments.

***

Hybrids combine internal combustion engines with electric motors to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions by switching between or combining power sources.

***

Turbochargers increase engine power by forcing extra compressed air into the combustion chambers, improving performance without significantly increasing engine size.

***

Rear-wheel drive layouts send power to the rear axle, often preferred in performance cars for balanced handling and weight distribution.

***

All-wheel drive delivers power to all four wheels, enhancing traction and stability in adverse weather and off-road conditions.

***

Manual transmissions allow drivers to manually select gears, offering direct control over engine performance and efficiency.

***

Automatic transmissions shift gears without driver input using hydraulic or electronic controls, providing ease of use and smooth acceleration.

***

Fuel injection systems precisely meter and deliver fuel into the engine, improving efficiency, power delivery, and emissions control compared to carburetors.

***

Diesel engines operate on compression ignition, offering higher torque and better fuel economy than gasoline engines, commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles.

***

Aerodynamic design reduces air resistance, improving fuel economy and high-speed stability by shaping the carâ€™s body to minimize drag.

***

Regenerative braking systems in electric and hybrid vehicles recapture kinetic energy during deceleration to recharge the batteries and increase efficiency.
